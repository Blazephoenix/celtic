# Celtic CSS
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active%20development-yellow)

Celtic is a CSS Framework I created to be as customizable as possible while still being lightweight and relatively useful. This is mostly for personal use but if you find it to be suitable for your needs, feel free to use and tweak as you like.
